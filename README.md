# TripNest - Flight Booking UI

TripNest is a modern and responsive flight booking website UI built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This is a **practice project** created to sharpen my Tailwind CSS skills by building a travel-related user interface.

⚠️ **Note:** This is just a **landing page design**, created for practice purposes only. It does not include any real booking functionality or backend system.

The goal of this project is to explore how Tailwind CSS can be used to quickly build elegant, fully responsive layouts without writing custom CSS.  
TripNest features a clean and intuitive layout inspired by modern travel websites, focusing on:

- Clean sectioning and layout structure
- User-friendly flight search UI
- Mobile-first responsive design principles
- Pure utility-first Tailwind CSS, without any JavaScript or frameworks

This project is part of my learning journey toward mastering frontend web development.  
I plan to enhance this in the future with interactivity using JavaScript or integrate it into a full-stack travel booking application.
